# Three.js Wavy Plane Visualizer

A dynamic 3D visualization that combines BÃ©zier surfaces with animated wave patterns using Three.js. The project uses Bernstein polynomials to create a smooth parametric surface controlled by a 4x4 grid of control points, with an additional sinusoidal wave animation that creates mesmerizing flowing patterns. The result is an interactive 3D surface that users can explore with orbit controls.
